 # MASS_ASSIGNMENTS
 # By default mass-assignments are prohibited in 
 #   config/initializers/protect_models_from_mass_assignment.rb
 #
 # The problem with mass assignment is that some malicious [cr|h]acker might write a script to 
 # PUT something like name=New+Name&admin=1, thereby adding himself as an administrative user! 
 # This would be a Bad Thingâ„¢. The standard solution to this problem is to use attr_accessible 
 # in the model to declare explicitly the attributes that can be modified by mass assignment.
